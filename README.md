- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @GWFootsteps
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in how mapping physical locations can enrich historical research by seeing where people intersect with each other...
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning to drive Mapbox GL JS, after realising that KML (although the inspiration for my learning curve) was just too clunky. Since I decided to shift my project to webmap, there's been a pretty steep learning curve. The generosity of the Github community with their code has blown me away - have come a long way in a few weeks - some days my head nearly explodes, but that's a good thing!
